# SOC-Analyst Projects

Welcome to my SOC Analyst home lab portfolio!  
This repository documents my learning journey as I build, break, and secure systems in a safe lab environment through daily/weekly SOC practice projects.

Each project folder contains:

- 🔝Overview: Provides the summary of what the project is about
- 📝 Objectives: What is to be learned during the project
- 🔄️ Process: Lists in chronological order the steps taken to until project completion
- 🧱Challenges: Issues that were run into during the project with included solutions
- 🛫 Takeaways: What else I learned in conjunction with the objectives
